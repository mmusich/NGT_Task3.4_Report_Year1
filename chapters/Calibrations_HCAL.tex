\subsection{HCAL Calibrations}

Out of the 326 conditions in the HLT GT, 37 are related to HCAL, of which 24 are relevant to Run 3 data-taking. From these, the following 9 are considered core and critical for data-taking:

In the context of an optimal calibrations workflow, the first 6 from Table \ref{tab:HCALCalibrations_critical} are considered fundamental\footnote{There exist fundamental HCAL conditions that can have a significant effect on HLT reconstruction which are implemented in the hardware directly (e.g. timing alignment, zero-suppression thresholds (\texttt{HcalZSThresholds}) and their conditions database records (assuming they exist) may not be considered critical (but e.g. used for bookkeeping purposes).} and generally require more frequent updates. These have been analyzed in more detail in the following sections.
