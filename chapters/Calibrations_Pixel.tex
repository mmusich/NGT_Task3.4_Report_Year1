\subsection{Pixel Tracker Calibrations}

Out of the 326 conditions in the HLT GT, 13 are related to the Silicon Pixel Tracker, of which 12 are relevant to Run 3 data-taking. From these, the following 8 are considered core and critical for data-taking:

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Bad components}
Description: This payload contains the DetIDs and ROCs associated with those DetIDs that are considered "dead." Used by tracking.\\
Record Name: \texttt{SiPixelQualityRcd} 

\subsubsection{Pixel Lorentz Angle}
Description: The 'no label' payload contains the value of LorentzAngle / Tesla for the Barrel Pixel and Forward Pixel separately (due to different HV constants, geometry, etc.).\\
Record Name: \texttt{SiPixelLorentzAngleRcd} 
Labels = none, \texttt{fromAlignment} or \texttt{forWidth} - given when included in a global tag.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{fromAlignment} : the LA offset generated by alignment (alternative to LA correction from templates).
\item \texttt{forWidth}: the LA for charge width estimate in the generic CPE (alternative to the same LA as for offset). 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pixel Templates}
Description: used in the templated tracking algorithm for Pixel RecHits.
Record Name:  \texttt{SiPixelTemplateDBObjectRcd} 

\subsubsection{Generic Errors}

Description: used in the generic CPE (cluster position estimation) algorithm as errors. Improves irradiation bias corrections (IBC) for data.
Record Name:  \texttt{SiPixelGenErrorDBObjectRcd}

\subsubsection{Pixel Alignment}
Record Name: \texttt{TrackerAlignmentErrorRcd} (for alignment), \texttt{TrackerSurfaceDeformationRcd} (for surface deformation) and  \texttt{GlobalPositonRcd} (defining the relative position of the subdetectors)
