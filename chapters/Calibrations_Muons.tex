\subsection{Muons System Calibrations}

Out of the 326 conditions in the HLT GT,
41 are related to the muon systems:
14 to the Drift Tubes (DTs),
20 to the Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs),
and
7 to the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs).
No conditions are related to the Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) as of 2024,
and
the RPCs don't have calibrations that can affect the data quality.
The only conditions that are considered core for data-taking are:

\end{table}

In all conditions related to the muon systems, all workflows are manual, the frequency of updates is small, and payloads are always kept the same between online and offline.
As such, we conclude that the muon system doesn't provide any candidate conditions for the NGT project.
